         <div class="class12"> Hi My name is Aditya. I am the person behind Spanr Systems. I am a professional computer scientist. I did my graduation in Computer Science studies from Biju Pattnaik University of Technology. I started my carrier with Tata Consultancy Services, Mumbai. There on I worked with several MNCs and gained experience in a number of languages including C/C++/Java/Python. I have experience in both platform level software development and application level software development. </div>

         <heading> Portfolio </heading>
         <div class="class13"> My portfolio has a range of projects from high level application development to low level device driver development<br><br>
            Internet Of Things<br>
            1) Development of minimal SPI controller drivers and development of dependent SPI Flash
            drivers for firmware for new embedded microcontroller board from Intel. Successful verification of
            functioning of SPI controller and SPI flash devices.
            <br>
            2) Development of minimal I2C controller drivers for firmmware for new embedded microcontroller
            board from Intel. Successful verification of functioning of I2C controller.<br>
            3) Development of minimal UART controller drivers for firmware for new embedded microcontroller
            board from Intel. Successful verification of UART controller. 
            <br><br>
            Board Support Packages, Board bring up, device drivers.<br>
            Primary Responsibilities:<br>
            a. Part of team that developed the Minimonitor code which is the first level bootloader for
            Renesas RCar E2 SOC and ARM Cortex A7 processor based board.<br>
            b. Ported U-boot as the secondary boot loader on the board. GPIO Pin muxing and
            understanding of schematic<br>
            c. Ported linux on the board and addition of new devices.<br>
            d. Developed I2C device driver for IPOD authentication chip.<br>
            e. Developed Inter core communication driver for communication between ARM cortex A7 and
            SH4A processor.<br>
            f. Kernel Code testing of drivers using kgdb and kdb. <br><br>
            Development of simulator for CMS using C++/Eclipse IDE<br>
            CMS is a software to manage all the weaponry and sensors on Navy Ships. Weaponry includes the
            missile systems and guns. Sensors include radars and sonars. To test CMS we need a simulator
            of the environment i.e the scenarios, weaponry and sensors. <br>
            Primary Responsibilities:<br>
            a. Requirements capturing. Preparation of Software Requirements Specification Document for the
            simulator using IBM DOORS.<br>
            b. Software design. Preparation of class diagrams, interaction diagrams in Enterprise Architect. <br>
            c. Code development. Writing and testing code for the simulator <br><br>
